# Code Generation

MANDATORY: Follow stage-protocol.md for approval gates, question format, and completion messages.

## Steps

### Critical Rules

- Application code goes to workspace root, NEVER to the record dir
- Brownfield: modify files in-place. NEVER create duplicates like ClassName_modified.java
- Add data-testid attributes to interactive UI elements for test automation

### Step 1: Read All Unit Artifacts

Read all design artifacts for the current unit:
- Functional design from `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/functional-design/` (if exists)
- NFR requirements from `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/nfr-requirements/` (if exists)
- NFR design from `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/nfr-design/` (if exists)
- Infrastructure design from `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/infrastructure-design/` (if exists)
- Domain design (component catalogue) from `<record>/inception/domain-design/components.md` (if exists)
- Contracts from `<record>/inception/contract-design/contract-summary.md` (if exists)
- Unit definition from `<record>/inception/units-generation/unit-of-work.md` (if exists)
- Story map from `<record>/inception/units-generation/unit-of-work-story-map.md` (if exists)
- Requirements from `<record>/inception/requirements-analysis/requirements.md` (if exists)

Incremental scopes (bugfix, poc, refactor, security-patch) skip units-generation and domain-design by design; when those inputs are absent, scope the work from the requirements and, on brownfield, the reverse-engineered code knowledge base at `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/` — never invent the content of a missing artifact.

### Step 2: PART 1 — Planning

Create a detailed code generation plan at `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/code-generation/code-generation-plan.md` with checkboxes for each implementation step. Include story-to-code-step traceability — map each plan step back to the user story it implements.

Plan should cover (as applicable to the unit):
- [ ] Business logic implementation
- [ ] API/endpoint layer
- [ ] Repository/data access layer
- [ ] Database migrations/schema changes
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Configuration files
- [ ] Documentation (inline and API docs)
- [ ] Deployment artifacts (Dockerfiles, IaC)

**Test files are MANDATORY in the plan.** Consult the active test strategy (stage-protocol.md §8 "Test Strategy") to determine test scope and volume:
- **Minimal strategy**: Unit test files only, requirement-driven (1 test per requirement, happy-path floor per component)
- **Standard strategy**: Unit test files per component (5-8 tests each) + integration test stubs for key boundaries
- **Comprehensive strategy**: Unit + integration + E2E test files per component (10-15 tests each)

The plan MUST include steps for:
- [ ] Test files appropriate to the active test strategy
- [ ] Test configuration (vitest.config, jest.config, or equivalent)

If the plan presented to the user omits test file steps, add them before presenting. Tests are not deferred to Build and Test — that stage verifies and extends, not creates from scratch.

Number each plan step sequentially (Step 1, Step 2, etc.) for clear execution ordering and traceability.

**Recommended plan structure** (adapt if architecture warrants a different ordering):

```
Step 1: Project structure setup (directories, config files, package.json/Cargo.toml/etc.)
Step 2: Data models / database schema / migrations
Step 3: Business logic layer (core domain logic, services)
Step 4: Business logic tests (unit tests for Step 3)
Step 5: API / endpoint layer (routes, controllers, handlers)
Step 6: API tests (unit + integration tests for Step 5)
Step 7: Repository / data access layer (queries, ORM config)
Step 8: Frontend components (if applicable — UI components, pages, state)
Step 9: Frontend tests (component tests, interaction tests)
Step 10: Configuration and environment setup (.env templates, build config)
Step 11: Test configuration (vitest.config, jest.config, or equivalent)
Step 12: Documentation (inline docs, API docs, README updates)
```

This layer-by-layer approach ensures dependencies are built before dependents (data models before business logic, business logic before API). Deviate when the architecture requires it (e.g., event-driven systems, microservices with independent stacks).

Also create
`<record>/construction/{unit-name}/code-generation/unit-test-instructions.md`
before Plan Approval. Consult the active test strategy (stage-protocol.md §8
"Test Strategy") and use the matching unit-test scope:

- **Minimal strategy**: Requirement-driven unit tests (1 test per requirement,
  happy-path floor per component), approximately 5-15 tests total
- **Standard strategy**: 5-8 tests per component, with key behavior coverage
- **Comprehensive strategy**: 10-15 tests per component, with thorough coverage

Include:
- Test framework setup and configuration
- How to run THIS UNIT's tests
- Expected coverage targets
- Mocking/stubbing guidance
- Test data management

Every run command in this file MUST be scoped to this unit only, using exact
test file paths or an exact unit filter. A bare project-wide command like
`npm test` is not acceptable. Build and Test executes every unit's commands,
so an unscoped command would rerun the whole suite once per unit.

Present a summary of the unit test instructions together with the plan summary
to the user.

### Step 3: Plan Approval

Before presenting the approval, create or update
`<record>/construction/{unit-name}/code-generation/code-generation-questions.md`
with a **Plan Approval** question that covers both
`code-generation-plan.md` and `unit-test-instructions.md`, both options below,
and a blank `[Answer]:` tag:

- "Approve Plan" — proceed to code generation
- "Request Changes" — revise the plan

Then present that question as a structured question and STOP the turn. Fill the
`[Answer]:` tag only after the human explicitly responds. On "Request Changes",
record that answer, revise the plan and unit test instructions as needed, reset
the Plan Approval `[Answer]:` to blank, and present the question again. Any
post-approval change to `unit-test-instructions.md` reopens Plan Approval:
reset the `[Answer]:` to blank and re-ask before generation. Do not begin Step
4, dispatch the developer agent, or infer approval from a forwarding-loop
continuation. Only an explicit "Approve Plan" response authorizes generation
from the approved versions of both files.

### Step 4: PART 2 — Generation

Before delegating, display to the user:
"Generating code for [N] plan steps. This may take several minutes depending on project complexity. I'll show a summary when complete."

Delegate to Task tool with subagent_type="aidlc-developer-agent".

The aidlc-developer-agent persona and its knowledge are loaded automatically by the named agent. Do NOT manually inject the persona in the prompt.

Include in the delegation prompt:
- As the first line, the exact target marker `AIDLC-UNIT: <directive.unit>` (or
  the current unit name when the single-iteration directive has no `unit`
  field). This marker identifies the one unit whose approved plan authorizes
  the dispatch; do not repeat it for contextual dependencies.
- Design artifacts for the CURRENT UNIT ONLY (not all units)
- A 1-2 line summary of each inception-phase artifact with its file path (requirements summary, stories summary, app design summary) — the subagent can Read specific files if it needs full content
- The approved code-generation-plan.md (full content)
- The approved unit-test-instructions.md (full content)
- Project workspace details (languages, frameworks, conventions from aidlc-state.md)
- Instructions to execute each plan step sequentially and mark checkboxes as completed

The subagent generates all code, test files, and configuration artifacts in the workspace.

### Step 5: Generate Code Summary

After subagent completes, create `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/code-generation/code-summary.md` documenting:
- Files created/modified
- Key implementation decisions
- Test coverage summary
- Any deviations from the plan

Create
`<record>/construction/{unit-name}/code-generation/traceability.json`.
Enumerate every assigned AC, detailed `NFRx.y`, and `BRx.y` (or direct `FR` /
`NFR` IDs when incremental scope skipped the design chain). Every `OK` target
must be one existing workspace-relative implementation or test file:

```json
{
  "stage": "code-generation",
  "unit": "u1-auth",
  "upstream_ids": ["AC1.1.1", "NFR1.1", "BR1.1"],
  "coverage": [
    { "id": "AC1.1.1", "status": "OK", "target": "src/auth/login.ts" },
    { "id": "NFR1.1", "status": "OK", "target": "src/cache/redis.ts" },
    { "id": "BR1.1", "status": "OK", "target": "src/auth/policy.ts" }
  ]
}
```

### Step 6: Completion Handoff

Hand completion to `stage-protocol.md` via
`bun .kiro/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage code-generation --result <outcome>`.
That `report` call owns every lifecycle transition and advancement; never perform one in prose, and never narrate this bookkeeping to the user.

### Step 7: Completion

Present completion message and approval gate:

```
# :computer: Code Generation Complete — {unit-name}
```

Summary of code produced (files, tests, key decisions), then:

```
**Review:** `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/code-generation/`
```

Approval gate: strictly 2-option (Approve / Request Changes).

> **Note — orchestrator-managed completion gating.** Step 3 Plan Approval is a mandatory hard stop in every execution mode, including Bolt execution: generation must never begin before the human chooses "Approve Plan". Only the Step 7 completion approval gate is suppressed by the orchestrator during normal Bolt execution. A single Bolt-level gate (or batch-level gate for parallel Bolt batches) covers completion for all Units in the Bolt. The completion gate still exists here for direct-invocation use (e.g., `/aidlc --stage code-generation` re-running a single Unit), and subagents invoked via Task must NOT invoke that completion gate themselves — the orchestrator owns completion-gate presentation across the batch.

## Sensors

This stage produces TypeScript/JavaScript code in the active Bolt
worktree. Generated code lives at the workspace root (NEVER under
the record dir); the planning, plan-approval, and summary artefacts
(`code-generation-plan.md`, `code-generation-questions.md`,
`unit-test-instructions.md`, `code-summary.md`) live under
`<record>/construction/{unit-name}/code-generation/`.

The imported sensors check the code outputs and per-unit markdown artefacts:

- **`required-sections`** verifies each markdown artefact has the generic
  document-shape floor (at least 2 H2 headings), including the per-unit unit
  test instructions.
- **`linter`** wraps the project's configured linter (eslint by default).
  Fires on every Write/Edit matching its `matches: "**/*.{ts,js}"` filter.
  Failure mode: lint violations land as `SENSOR_FAILED` audit rows with
  detail at `<record>/.aidlc-sensors/code-generation/linter-<iso>.md`.
- **`type-check`** wraps the project's configured type-checker (tsc by
  default). Fires on `**/*.{ts,tsx}`. Failure mode: type errors emit
  `SENSOR_FAILED` with similar detail.
- **`traceability`** validates the per-Unit coverage table and verifies every
  `OK` target is an existing workspace-relative file.

`upstream-coverage` is intentionally NOT imported here. The stage consumes a
broad, scope-dependent design set, while its load-bearing validation is the
shape of the planning artefacts plus the lint, type, and traceability checks
on generated code. The `required-sections` floor does not apply to the
structured `traceability.json` file, which the `traceability` sensor owns.

## Learn

While running this stage, maintain a running log in
`<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md` (create on stage start if absent).
Append entries under four standard headings:

- **Interpretations** — choices made where the stage prose was ambiguous
- **Deviations** — places you intentionally departed from the stage prose, and why
- **Tradeoffs** — alternatives considered and why you picked what you did
- **Open questions** — anything to confirm before next run, or uncertain context

Format each entry with an ISO 8601 timestamp:
`- 2026-05-20T10:14:32Z — <summary>; <context>`

Before the approval gate, read memory.md and surface candidates as a
structured question. For each entry the user keeps, write to the appropriate
harness destination per `stage-protocol.md` §13 — never to this stage file:

- Prescriptive rule → a practice line under the routed heading in
  `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/project.md` (default) or `team.md` (promoted)
- Verification check → new manifest at `.kiro/sensors/aidlc-<id>.md`
  (capability descriptor only — no `applies_to`); add the new id to
  the relevant stage's `sensors: [...]` frontmatter list to wire it

Even when nothing surfaces, still ask the mandatory "Anything to add for next time?" question from stage-protocol.md section 13. Do not infer "Nothing to add." Only after the human answers that question may you proceed to the gate. The memory.md
file stays in the artefact directory as part of the stage's permanent record.

Stage files are immutable framework artefacts — the ritual writes into the
harness, not into this file. Next time this stage runs, the new rules and
sensors load automatically.
